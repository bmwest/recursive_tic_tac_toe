# recursive_tic_tac_toe
This is a game of tic-tac-toe where many of the game actions are executed recursively.

* ```print_grid(board_a)``` and ```print_grid(board_b)``` will show you what a populated board will look like.
* ```board_c``` is empty, and ready for simulation.
* To see a simulation, clone this repo, and run ```ruby game.rb``` from the project's root directory.
* The game will only exit once all tiles are filled.
* Check back soon for scoring capability!
